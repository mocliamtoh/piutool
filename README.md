## Data Coverage
There are two songlist data provided based on 
Pump It Up XX v2.08 (final patch).

Pump It Up Prime2 v2.05.0 (final patch) data also available under legacy version branch.

All removed contents will not be included.
I plan to maintain the songlist after the release of later versions, but will not focus on Pro/Infinity songlist data. (feel free to contribute one, though)
